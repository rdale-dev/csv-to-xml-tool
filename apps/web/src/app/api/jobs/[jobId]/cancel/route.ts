/**
 * Cancel an in-flight conversion.
 *
 * The database is the authoritative source of state: we flip
 * ``job.status`` to ``"cancelled"`` immediately so the progress page,
 * dashboard, and any future reads see the cancellation even if the
 * worker is still crunching. We then poke the worker to drop the job
 * at its next checkpoint (best-effort — we don't block on the
 * response).
 *
 * Only jobs in status ``"converting"`` can be cancelled. The Cancel
 * button in the UI is only rendered while a job is converting (see
 * ``convert/[jobId]/progress/page.tsx``), and the /start and /preview
 * endpoints unconditionally write other statuses — so marking an
 * ``uploaded`` / ``previewed`` / ``mapping`` job as cancelled would
 * create a contradictory state that a later start or preview call
 * could revive. For anything else we return the current status
 * idempotently so repeat clicks are safe.
 *
 * The /start route's background handler uses conditional ``updateMany``
 * against ``status: "converting"`` so a late-arriving complete or
 * error from the worker cannot overwrite a cancellation that landed
 * in the race window.
